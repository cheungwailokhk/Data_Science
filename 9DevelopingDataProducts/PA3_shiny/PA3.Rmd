## Objective

This is a peer assessed assignment in the Cousera Developing Data Products by Johns Hopkins University). This aimed to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 

[https://cwl286.shinyapps.io/PA3_shiny/](https://cwl286.shinyapps.io/PA3_shiny/)


This Shiny application was trying to visualize world's demographics data from the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). It visualized 5 dataset, which were collected on 04/06/2021. It was created by Shiny and Plotly library in R language to provide basic interactive features.

## Features:
1. Input widget: sliderbar, checkbox, selectizeInput, action buttons.
2. Operation on the ui input in server.
    -   User can filter countries by Region, or Income groups, or both. 
    -   User can limit the years of data to display.
    -   User can compare data among countries. 
    -   Our server will filter the relevant data of the corresponding countries based on the input by users.
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
    -   Thanks to the Plotly library, users can interact with the charts by zooming, burshing data, and comparing data on hover.
